                With my interest and passion for the software industry,
                I continue my education life at 42 Istanbul. As someone who is focused on learning,
                improving myself and increasing my skills, I am looking for a position
                where I can share my knowledge and experience that I can use in the industry.
                I am extremely eager to continuously improve myself and
